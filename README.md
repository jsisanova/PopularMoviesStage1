# PopularMoviesStage1

## Project Overview
Popular Movies Stage 1, created as a part of Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Program.
In this project, I built an app to help users discover the most popular and 

This app helps users discover the most popular and top rated movies.

Please note : The app uses the Movie Database API. To run the app, you need to request a free API key from themoviedb.org. Create your account here: https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup
Enter the API key in the file JsonUtils.java where it says "Enter your API key here".

## Your app will
- Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
- Allow your user to change sort order via a setting: The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
- Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
      original title
      movie poster image thumbnail
      plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
      user rating (called vote_average in the api)
      release date

## What Will I Learn?
- to fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API
- to use adapter and RecycleView to populate grid layout
- to incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write (e.g. Picasso)
- to launch activity via Intent (using Parcelable)
